Mockrates
============

This is a clone of the Dev Bootcamp Socrates program as completed with 2 other students at Dev Bootcamp in week 6. It is still in development.

History
------------------

- Built in 3 days by 3 developers
- Still a WIP (currently seeding db, cleaning up ux/ui a bit, and squashing bugs)
- Is a clone of the dev bootcamp socrates system: http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/login
- features include:
  * Dual login (for paired programming)
  - Dual submittal of challenges 
  - SQL Designer integration (interactive visual schema designer)
  - Create challenges using markdown (only if you're an admin )
  - Github oauth integration
  - Github Gist creation when challenge started
  - interactive challenges (like codeschool  or codecademy) - these let you know if you got the problem right or wrong.
  - etc.

NOTE: The ux may not be intuitive to an outside user because the socrates system is designed to be used by boots and instructors, who get on-boarded and such. 

As stated this is a WIP
