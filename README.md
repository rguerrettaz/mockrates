Mockrates
============

This is a clone of the Dev Bootcamp Socrates program as completed with 2 other students at Dev Bootcamp in week 6. It is still in development.

History
------------------

- Built in 3 days by 3 developers
- Still a WIP (currently seeding db and cleaning up ux/ui a bit)
- Is a clone of the dev bootcamp socrates system: http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/login
- features include:
  * Dual login (for paired programming)
  - Dual submittal of challenges 
  - SQL Designer integration (interactive visual schema designer)
  - If admin user, can create challenges using markdown 
  - Github oauth integration
  - Github Gist creation when challenge started
  - interactive challenges (like codeschool  or codecademy) - these let you know if you got the problem right or wrong.
  - etc. 



Directions for testing
---------------------
- login using these creds: 
  - email: rguerrettaz@yahoo.com
  - pass: admin1234
- create a challenge using markdown
- click on a challenge from challenges tab, start a challenge, and submit a challenge (you will notice your gravitar will show up in the next submitted column)
- Login another user 
  - email: jameshamilton@gmail.com
  - pass: dbc
- Submit a challenge, you will notice both gravitars show up next to the challenge
- click on sql designer and play around a bit with "add table" and "add field". For full experience, click the 'Save / Load' button and paste this xml code on this page: https://gist.github.com/rguerrettaz/c52e1e49d005ad18bdfd into the left box and click "Load XML"

The ux may not be intuitive to an outside user because the socrates system is designed to be used by boots and instructors, who get on-boarded and such. 

As stated we are in the process of seeding and updating the UI.
